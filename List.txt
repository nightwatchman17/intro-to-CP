Graph Topics:
=========================================

1. Terms and Definitions
2. Graph Representation (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
3. Graph Traversal Algorithm
    i. DFS - Depth First Search
    ii. BFS - Breadth First Search
4. DFS Variations
    - Number of Connected Components
    - Size of Connected Components
    - Bipartite ( Bicoloring ) Checking by DFS
    - Single Source Shortest Path (on Tree) by DFS // SSSP
    - whether a given Sequence of Nodes are Valid with DFS Traversal
    - DFS on 2-D Grid // Flood Fill
    - Cycle Detection in Graph by DFS
    - IN time, Out Time (Discovery, Finishing)
          * Whethe A Node is in the Subtree of another Node
    - Diametre of a Tree
    - Subtree Size by DFS in O(N) 

5. BFS Variations
    - Single Source Shortest Path in Graph
    - Printing Shortest Path Sequence
    - whether a given Sequence of Nodes are Valid with BFS Traversal
    - Bipartite Checking by BFS
    - BFS on 2-D Grid
    - Multi-Source BFS
    - 0-1 BFS
6. Topological Sorting
7. Disjoint Set Union
8. Dijkstra // SSSP in Weighthed Graph
    - shortest path printing by Dijkstra
